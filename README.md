## Description

Plexus aims to be a one stop solution for all kinds of digital events like Quizes. It specially targets the yearly online events happening in our college. This platform will allow other societies to host their events without any friction or technical know-how.

## To Start Local Server -
 A. Setting Up the server -
   1. Install heroku-cli with `npm i -g heroku-cli`.
   2. Install nodemon with `npm i -g nodemon`.
   3. Run `npm i` to install the server-side dependencies.
   4. Run `touch .env` then open it and fill it like the sample .env file.
   5. Run `npm start` and make sure the mongo instance is also running.

 B. Setting Up the client -
   1. Run `cd client ` in separate terminal to change into client directory.
   2. In client directory run `npm i` to install client-side dependencies.
   3. In client directory run `touch .env`.
   4. In client directory run `npm start`.
   5. Navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser.

## Sample .env file
```
NODE_ENV=development
port=5000
googleClientID=-------------.apps.googleusercontent.com
googleClientSecret=--------------
mongoURI=mongodb://localhost:27017/plexusdb
cookieKey=---------------
HOST_URL=http://localhost:5000
sendGridApiKey=--------------
sendGridTemplateId=----------------
```

## Milestones
 1. [ ] Setup a basic server.

## Guidelines
 1. First make an issue and then start working on it.
 2. Always make a separate branch in following format name#feature. Eg: aditya#add-bootstrap. (Words are separated by -).
 3. In the commit message do mention the issue no. Eg: fixes #1.
 4. Use proper code formatting. We use [CodeFormatter Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/akalongman/sublimetext-codeformatter).
 5. Do mention if `npm install` is needed after merging the commit.

Note -
1. Heroku Cli is used for handling **environment variables** and deploys.
2. To get **googleClientID** and **googleClientSecret** make a new project at [here](https://console.developers.google.com) and enable the Google+ api.
3. If you don't have **mongodb** locally, then create a remote db [here](https://mlab.com/home) or you can download it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs&_ga=2.47151591.1318332256.1507577170-1071278786.1507217039#community)
4. Whenever you commit the code. Prettier runs and it formats the code. If any changes are made then do stage again and commit.
