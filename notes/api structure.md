## Api Structure

  * There must be atleast 5 routes for each entity - 
  
        - GET /{entity}             (Eg:- GET /users)
        
        - GET /{entity}/:id         (Eg:- GET /users/59e59057fd816d1af4f27b15)
        
        - POST /{entity}            (Eg:- POST /users)
        
        - PUT /{entity}/:id         (Eg:- PUT /users/59e59057fd816d1af4f27b15)
        
        - DELETE /{entity}/:id      (Eg:- DELETE /users/59e59057fd816d1af4f27b15)
        
      Note that here we have to use the plural.

  * Cases where another type of routes will be used - 

        - GET /{entity}/:name         (Eg:- GET /events/errata-18)

      To handle this, we have to make sure that our mongoose query has an OR operation which fetches either by name or by id.

  * As exposing the mongodb id for an entity to end users would be incorrect, we will use some other identifier.  

       Eg:- When details of particular event will be displayed, some identifier must be shown in the address bar (so that a user can share the event on social media). Here obviously we won't show the event mongo id, instead we will use the *slug* module to make a unique identifier for an event through the event's name.

   * However, it is still mandatory to make the route using mongo id also. This will help admin to debug the application consistently.

   * Query Parameter Format

       /api/{entity}/:id?fields[self]=field1&fields[self]=field2&fields[{includedEntity}]=field3&include={includedEntity}

       This results in 

       ```js
       {
         fields: {
           self: ['field1', 'field2'],
           includedEntity: 'field3'
         },
         include: {includedEntity}
       }
       ```

       Example : /api/events/5a17313e5134450a38febcbe?fields[self]=name&fields[_questions]=text&include=_questions&include=_winners

       This results in 

       ```js
       {
         fields: {
           self: 'name',
           _questions: 'text'
         },
         include: ['_questions', '_winners']
       }
       ```
